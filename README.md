## About

[Capstone Project] - I created a SPA (single page application) site for my capstone project. This website was created for a company called Sembrana located in Quito, Ecuador. This project demonstrates my proficiency in React, React-Router, Node, Express, API's as well as other front-end and back-end essentials. This project was completed in two weeks.

## Goals and Requirements

My goal was to build a full stack single page application from the ground up. To accomplish this goal I used React, Express, and Node.js. Additionally, I also created my own API to obtain the vegetable card information. As for the styling, I aimed to create a highly cohesive and minimalistic website through the use of consistent fonts, iconography as well as using a predetermined colour pallette.

## Key Learnings

- Fully understood and implemented React fundamentals, including component lifecyle methods, using props and state as well as JSX.
- Utilized React-Router for declarative routing.
- Implemented the basics of Node.js and Express, created API endpoints in order to receive and return data.
- Used Semantic HTML, BEM methodoloy.
- Flexbox, SAAS, responsive and mobile-first design.
- Axios
